# Getting Started with Cake.AutoRest

Since AutoRest itself ships via NuGet, you won't need to set up anything first!

## Including the addin

At the top of your script, just add the following to install the addin *and* AutoRest:

```
#tool "AutoRest"
#addin nuget:?package=Cake.AutoRest
```

## Usage

The addin exposes a single property alias `AutoRest` with all of the AutoRest functionality available as methods.

You can just run AutoRest with all the defaults with:

```
Task("Use-Defaults")
    .Does(() => {
        AutoRest.Generate("./sample.json");
});
```

or use the fluent interface to control the generation process:

```
Task("Fluent-Interface")
.Does(() => {
    AutoRest.Generate("./sample.json", settings =>
        settings.UseNamespace("Cake")
            .UseClientName("Cake.AutoRest")
            .AddHeaderComment("Generated by Cake.AutoRest")
            .WithGenerator(CodeGenerator.AzureCSharp)
            .OutputToDirectory("./dist/client"));
});
```

You can find the full API reference on the "Reference" tab above.

## Settings

The fluent interface (shown above) is entirely optional. You can also create a settings object the "traditional" way and pass that in to the alias:

```
Task("Settings-Object")
.Does(() => {
var settings = new AutoRestSettings {
    Namespace = "Cake",
    Generator = CodeGenerator.AzureCSharp,
    GeneratorSettings = new CSharpGeneratorSettings {InternalConstructors = true},
    ClientName = "Cake.AutoRest",
    HeaderComment = "Generated by Cake.AutoRest",
    OutputDirectory = "./dist/client"
    };
    AutoRest.Generate("./sample.json", settings);
});
```
