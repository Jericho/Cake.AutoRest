# API documentation

Use the links on the left to navigate the addin's API. 

The `AutoTestRunner` and `AutoRestAliases` represent the "entry points" for the addin, while the `AutoRestSettings` and `AutoRestSettingsExtensions` are the object and fluent settings interfaces, respectively.

Currently, `CSharpGeneratorSettings` is the only `IGeneratorSettings` implementation, as it is the only AutoRest generator with specific settings.
